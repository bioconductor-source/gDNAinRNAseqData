Description: 
    Provides access to BAM files generated from RNA-seq data produced with different levels of gDNA contamination. It currently allows one to download a subset of the data published by Li et al., BMC Genomics, 23:554, 2022. This subset of data is formed by BAM files with about 100,000 alignments with three different levels of gDNA contamination.
